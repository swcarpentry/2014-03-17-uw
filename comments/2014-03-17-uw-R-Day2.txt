the comparison of apply, aggregate & ddply was helpful. I'm already familiar with some of those so it's good to see how to accomplish similar things with different functions.

Appreciate time all 3 instructors spent to troubleshoot and explain concepts that were particularly challenging.

Great workshop. Maybe small group stuff would be good.

The Noble schematic for file organization was helpful.

File organization discussion excellent.

Jenny is awesome! I wish she could teach me R all the time.

Great course, I learnt a lot. Thank-you very much to all 3 of you!!!

Went well. I fell like the later sessions would probably benefit from a better introduction to R syntax.

Good to go in detail with apply and aggregate commands and usage. Good amount of time for answering questions.

Jenny's presentation style is great. It's soooo helpful the way she translates each chunk of code into plain English.

"Tricks" with data-frames (aggregate, ddply) seem super useful.

The one-on-one help was really advantageous for this session.

Thanks for the one-on-one help. It makes a huge difference.

Really appreciate when we pause to make sure everyone is following.

Good to go through details of setting up a git repository and push/pull collaboration because lots of errors and questions come up.

Check data aggregation. Check pipelines. Check whirlwind tour through prewritten scripts to save time and illustrate concepts.

Excellent presentations. Lots of useful info and very clear explanations.

Jenny very clear and animated.

The afternoon session by Jenny was so informative -- she's a great teacher and I wish I could spend more time learning from her.
