Intro git local (Lynne)
---------------------------------


To improve:
-----------

Too slow +1

Using git in terminal was confusing and hard to follow

git discussion in terminal should be slower and more clear. Easy to get behind here

teaching git in the shell before teaching the shell seemend an odd choice

I think starting with the command prompt makes more sense

Much more hand holding and explanation was needed, especially for the shell portion

this session was not that helpful - who uses that? +1

structure of session was kind of funny

could have used more explanation on the theory

somewhat unclear (jargon) and difficult to follow +2

Could not always see previous commands in bash window

Would be nice to have pdf describing main points and installation steps distributed prior to session

volume and pacing was variable

Please speak up and more energetically +1

I got behind and lost track







Good/Keep:
----------





Data visualization with ggplot2 (Jenny)
-------------------------------------


To improve:
-----------

Would like to see more figure and table creation (for polished tables)

went a bit fast through the options +1

please provide cheat sheet before hand


Good/Keep
----------

ggplot was all good

Nice tour of ggplot

nice overview of options

awesome session +1

brilliant. Thank you!

examples very helpful +1

nice overview of grammar, which I hadn't fully appreciated before +1

loved seeing the different ways to use ggplot

great energy, clear instruction

Jenny is a great presenter - good slides, pace, energy

I liked the mix of typing code to get started, then switching to showing examples

great practice with vectors and ggplot

ooohhh - pretty graphs!



General comments:
-----------------


To improve:
-----------

a little more repetition of important points or syntax to help it sink in


Good/Keep:
----------

I really like when we have tasks to do

All the R stuff (vectors, data.frames, ggplot2) was cool and informative

Helpful to have code available to double-check
